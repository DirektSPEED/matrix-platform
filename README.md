# Futures At Present
- Can Scale Realy to Infinity!
- Compatible with near any Framework don't know anything that don't works at present.
- Ultra lightwight to get most out of the Hardware.
- Async NODE.JS Socket.IO Datatransfer
- Integrated VirtualSwitch fully RFC Compilant
- Auto Scale Docker Containers on Many Servers as it Would be One we can even Share RAM across all Server so we could run one Container on 6 servers each with 8 GB Ram with totall RAM usage of 48gb In a Single Docker Instance!
- Automated Algorythms for FailOver and ReLocate Instances think about it like Defragmentation of Processes
- Integrated LoadBalancing and Routing for Web Traffic
- All In One Stack for Providing PaaS or even IaaS
- Aims to be Much Faster then Mesos or Omega!
- Aims to be Much More LightWight then any Other
- Aims to be The Future of Web and even Application Hosting and Deployment.

Thanks go Out to!
Apache, Rackspace, Mozilla, Github, Google, Oracle, IBM, Docker.io, SUN, CISCO, NODE.JS, Freenode, Twitter, and many more will be complited that Guys who work there made this possible 

# Futures Planed
No Coments at present.

At present we are havy testing it in Production! as soon as we consider it as stable we will make big parts of it opensource.
